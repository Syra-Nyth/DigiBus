        Introduction to Navigating Digital Information
      </h2>
      <p>
        The average American spends 24 hours per week online but one in four US adults say that they are online almost constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Internet has so much helpful information. It connects us to each other, it allows more people to have a voice in public conversations, but of course the Internet is also littered with misleading, sensationalized, and downright false information.
      </p>
      <p>
        A joke made famous by the American writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a> goes: two young fish are swimming along one day when an older fish swims past and says, "Morning kids, how's the water?" The young fish just look at each other for a second and then swim on for a while. Then one says to the other, "What the heck is water?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Believing that you're immune to the seductions of false and misleading information is if anything a symptom of being influenced by false and misleading information. That joke is relevent here because much of what we're swimming in is new and strange and we are still figuring it out together.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this series Crash Course has teamed up with <a href="https://www.poynter.org/mediawise/">MediaWise</a>, a project out of the <a href="https://www.poynter.org/">Poynter Institute</a> that was created with support from Google. The Poynter Institute is a nonprofit journalism school and the goal of MediaWise is to teach students how to assess the accuracy of information they encounter online.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're gonna share some tools that are proven to work when it comes to evaluating the quality and accuracy of information. We may not figure out exactly what water is but we're gonna try to learn to improve our swimming.
