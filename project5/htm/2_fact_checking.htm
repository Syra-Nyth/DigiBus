        Fact Checking
      </h1>
      <p>
        A lot of us are asking whether the Internet is a net positive or a net negative in our lives, but that question might be what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen">Buddhist Zen</a> masters called "a question wrongly put." Instead, the better question might be "how can I make the internet a more positive force in my life and the lives of others?" Part of the answer is that better information leads to better decision making, which leads to a better world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://sheg.stanford.edu/">Stanford History Education Group</a> have done a lot of research on how Internet users evaluate the information they find. In one Stanford study college students, history, professors and fact checkers were all asked to look at two websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the professors and students thought the first site was more credible because they focused on the site itself. They spent time examining and reading the website, noticing that there were footnotes and checking out its design elements.cThe professors and students focused on the websites themselves and how they presented information to decide which was more credible that meant they didn't do a great job of evaluating the source itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact checkers on the other hand did much better because they consistently asked themselves three questions while evaluating the sites:
        <ul>
          <li>
            who is behind this information?
          </li>
          <li>
            what is the evidence for their claims?
          </li>
          <li>
            what do other sources say about the organization and its claims?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions are a really useful framework when you want to interpret the accuracy of information you've encountered.
