    <h1>
      Deciding Who To Trust
    </h1>
    <p>
      We work hard to bring you entertaining and educational videos on everything from science to religion but how do you know that we’re telling you the truth? And is our work invalidated by the fact we sometimes make mistakes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless you’re an expert in everything, you don’t know, and that is precisely what makes it so easy to be misled, both online and off. None of us has the time or talent to become an expert in everything. So we have to trust information from outside of ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have to find a way to accredit and trust experts, even though they will be wrong
