      Lateral Reading
    </h1>
    <p>
      Today we are going to learn one of the most important skills of 21st century life. Understanding where information came from helps us to understand if it's reliable. How do you even find a source in a world where no one has to cite sources and what citations do exist are perpetually disappearing?

      Information does not just appear even if it's automated or driven by an algorithm. All information is produced by someone but it's also produced for a purpose. Newspapers are created by journalists and editors to inform the public about things editors think they should know but of course they also have to sell subscriptions and advertisements to support themselves. Advertisements are created by companies to convince customers to buy or use their products, movies and books are created to entertain or to stir up important cultural conversations or both The lines between these motives are not always clear: advertisements often feel informative and sometimes seek to be informative, and while journalism should seek to inform
      journalists are humans and they make choices both about what to cover and how to cover it.

      To know more about who's sharing the information that we're consuming we just need to learn to read differently. We tend to read websites like we read books or articles: we start at the top of the page, look at the title and scroll down from there. We read vertically and many websites look legitimate when you're reading vertically because you're only seeing what their creators want you to see. Creators know what we think makes websites look authoritative: a well-designed logo, references and citations, professional photography, and no grammatical errors or typos. When you read vertically it is often impossible to distinguish reliable information from unreliable.

      Introducing other strategies into your reading, like looking elsewhere for additional information, can help you find out a lot more when you're on a new website. Instead of staying put and taking their word for it you should just leave, open a new tab, and start looking for more information: that's called lateral reading. It's lateral because instead of moving up and down you're moving from tab to tab.
