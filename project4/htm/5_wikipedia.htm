      Using Wikipedia
    </h1>
    <p>
      You shouldn't use a single site as a definitive source when evaluating new information - <a href="./3_lateral_reading.htm">we have to read laterally.</a> That means looking to other sources to provide context. When used correctly, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> can be a great place to start.

      Many of us have been told by teachers, librarians, parents, peers, co-workers, friends, pen pals, babysitters, nieces and nephews, celebrity spokespeople, Instagram famous dogs, our favorite baristas, particularly cogent toddlers, religious leaders, Jeff Goldblum, long-lost cousins, and anonymous Twitter trolls never to use Wikipedia. You've probably heard that Wikipedia is full of totally unusable unreliable information that was written by random Internet users. I'm here to dispel that myth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's true that wikipedia is editable by almost anyone and its content is created by a community of mostly volunteer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians.</a> The whole network is owned and supported by a nonprofit called the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a> and Wikipedia has become the Internet's largest general reference work with over 40 million articles in 301 languages including over 5.7 million articles in English.
    </p>

      You can't learn everything about a topic from its Wikipedia page the universe is of course much more complicated than even an endless online encyclopedia could account for. What makes Wikipedia useful to citizens of the Internet is its breadth; it provides information on more topics than any print encyclopedia could and a top-notch Wikipedia page can provide a solid overview of a topic and also provide citations to sources for its claims.

      When a Wikipedia first launched back in 2001 it got a bad reputation because of how easy it was to create and edit articles. This is likely why teachers and others have warned you against it, but Wikipedia has grown up a lot since 2001. Today, anyone with an internet connection can still edit most pages on Wikipedia but there are much more rigorous content policies in place and more Wikipedians and even bots around to prevent and correct bad edits. you also now have to be a registered user to create an article and article topics have to meet a standard of notability before they can even be created. Wikipedians also adhere to a set of rules when editing and writing content. Their core content policies are summed up by three key phrases:
      <ul>
        <li>
          a neutral point of view, meaning content must be represented fairly proportionately and without bias.
        </li>
        <li>
          no original research, meaning all material must come from a published reliable source.
        </li>
        <li>
          verifiability, meaning people reading and editing articles must be able to check that the information comes from a reliable source.
        </li>
      </ul>
