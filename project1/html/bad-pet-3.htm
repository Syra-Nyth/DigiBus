            <h2>Snakes</h2>
            <p>
                Snakes too are terrible pets to have. They're scaly and rough, so you can't pet them. You have to be careful when handling them to make sure that they don't bite you, and if you have a constrictor, then them giving you a hug is actually them trying to kill you. Even if they aren't, you can't take them out in public without someone screaming bloody murder.
                <br> Trust me, you don't want a snake as a pet.
            </p>
