        Uniforms

        <p>
          Uniforms are important in that they set a tone for the school, give us pride in belonging, and communicate our
          community expectations. At Rangi Ruru we expect all our students to wear the correct uniform in an appropriate
          manner whenever they are seen to be representing our school.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way a student dresses reflects the kind of person they are. Cleanliness, good grooming and appropriate
          attire
          all contribute to a healthy, productive learning atmosphere. An essential of good grooming is a clean, tidy,
          well-pressed uniform, which should be worn complete. The uniform code is also written in the Student Handbook
          and is strictly enforced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students are expected to wear the appropriate uniform in a tidy and appropriate manner, and we greatly
          appreciate parent support in this.
